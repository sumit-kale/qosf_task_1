# QOSF task 1 (bonus) 

### Cohort 4

**Problem Statement: Task 1 **


Design a quantum circuit that considers as input the following vector of integers numbers: 

[1,5,7,10]
returns a quantum state which is a superposition of indices of the target solution, obtaining in the output the indices of the inputs where two adjacent bits will always have different values. In this case the output should be: 1/\sqrt{2} * (|01> + |11>), as the correct indices are 1 and 3.

**Bonus:**
Design a general circuit that accepts vectors with random values of size 2n with m bits in length for each element and finds the state indicated above from an oracle.
